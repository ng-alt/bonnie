bonnie++ (1.00a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a 30 second startup delay when run as root.  A user lost some data
    because of running it as root, if they had run it as a regular account
    they would be OK.  I don't want this to happen again.

  * Zcav now displays an error if it can't read a single block.

  * Added some basic autoconf support which I will use to increase portability
    in future versions.

  * Now provides zcav.

  * Should compile with all old versions of gcc.

  * Fixed a warning on Alpha.

bonnie++ (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * License is now GPL.

  * Now include ZCAV in the same package.  ZCAV package should disappear.

  * ZCAV reads through a hard drive sequentially and reports the IO speeds for
    different zones of the drive.

  * Fixed a few minor issues with the documentation, and put the test programs
    in /usr/sbin as they aren't generally run by regular users.  Also use man
    section 8.

bonnie++ (0.99f) unstable; urgency=low
