Differences between Bonnie++ 1.00 and 2.00.

Version 2.00 is totally threaded, this has many subtle impacts on the way the
code works.  When you link with the threaded library the fgetc() and fputc()
library calls are replaced with thread-safe versions which take 5 times longer,
thus the per-char tests will record much lower results.  From 1.90a.

When closing files for the IO tests the operation is to fflush(NULL) to
flush any per-char IO and to fsync() each file handle.  This means on Linux
and other OSs that agressively cache writes the write performance will be
noticably less, but the results will be more accurate.  From 1.90b.

The number of seek processes is now 5 instead of 3.  Now almost all new hard
drives have some sort of seek reordering capability, and OSs are getting
smarter about maintaining queues.  This and the increasing popularity of RAID
arrays requires more seek procs to do a reasonable test.
